           If you want to know, I'm actually not too picky when it comes to food because I'll eat anything that's Halal and delicious. But most of what I eat is delicious. There are some that don't fit my throat, but it's okay, I just won't eat any more after that. In addition, I also like to try new foods to find new flavors in the world of food.
